          <h2>Howdy</h2>
          <p>Hi, I’m Elijah. I’m 18 years old and obsessed with building cool (and sometimes silly) things.</p>
          <p>I have always loved computers. I mean ALWAYS. I remember my aunt trying to explain wifi to me as a 7 year old and I was just fascinated. I love everything tech and I can always appreciate a smart solution to a tough problem. </p>
          <p>I also enjoy other things (sometimes) and i get obsessed with things for a while. Here is a brief history of my obsessions/hobbies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning to solve a Rubik's Cube (still can!)</li>
            <li>Card Tricks</li>
            <li>Throwing Cards</li>
            <li>Skateboarding (on a ripstik too)</li>
            <li>Competetive video games</li>
            <li>Juggling</li>
            <li>Guitar/Piano</li>
            <li>Boxing (still doing this one)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I will talk to you about any and all of these (though you probably know more than me about them)</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, I always come back to computers and programming. I love building things that make life easier, more fun or just anything cool or silly. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
          <p>Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about building cool stuff.</p>
